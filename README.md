# Zoolander Virtual Zoo
  
Do your kids ever beg you to go to the zoo on a rainy day?
Would you like to see wild animals in their natural habitats?
Or maybe you just wanna see some cute puppies and kittens?

Well here it is! Our app has camera feeds from across the globe 
bringing elephants, creatures of the sea and some loveable furry
friends right into the comfort of your home... 
Or anywhere you take your devices!

* When I am logged in,
* Then I am able to view landing/homepage.
* When I scroll right or left in the cams list,

like button and comment section.
